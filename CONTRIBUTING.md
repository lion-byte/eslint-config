Make sure that you have the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins) and [Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugins installed for your respective text editors!

## Local Testing

Running `npm test` is pretty good for basic testing. It's always helpful to add tests!

If your changes fail the test suite, either fix your code or refactor the tests to reflect the additions/changes. Also try to keep code coverage at least 90%.
